## BFS (BREADTH FIRST SEARCH)

# What is BFS ?

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. (like how heap added the node )

# When to use BFS?

- if we know that the node is potitoned in the upper level of the tree or graph, DFS is the best way
- good to find the shortest path

# Pros Vs Cons

Pros

- faster for short path graph or tree

Cons

- require more memory
