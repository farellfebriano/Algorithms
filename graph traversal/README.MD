# BFS VS DFS

## General Question of BFS vs DFS

1. if you know a solution not far from the root of the tree `bfs`

2. if the tree is very deep and solutions are rare

- `bfs` (dfs will take really long because the tree is somehow deep and the the solution are rare, hence it will take more time for dfs to find the solution)

3. if the tree is very wide `bfs`
4. if solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree `dfs`
5. determining whether a path exists between two nodes `dfs`
6. finding the shortest paths `bfs`
