# Reverse a String

## Example 1

Input: n = "work"<br>
Output: "krow"<br>

## Example 2

Input: n = "i am working"<br>
Output: gnikrow ma i<br>

## First Approach

- what is the base case
- what is the smallest amount of work i can do in each iteration

```javascript
function reverseString(s) {
  // What is the base case
  // What is the smallest amount of work i can do each iteration?
}
```
